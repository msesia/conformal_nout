\arguments{
\item{S_X}{:  calibration score vector.}

\item{S_Y}{: test score vector.}

\item{S}{: selection set in the index test set. If \code{NULL} the entire test set is selected.}

\item{g.hat}{: it can be either a character ("analytical") or a function denoting the outlier density.
If g.hat=="analytical" the test statistics are computed analytically withuout Monte Carlo estimation.}

\item{k}{: order of the LMPI test statistic to be specified when g.hat is "analytical".}

\item{alpha}{: significance level.}

\item{pvalue_only}{: logical value. If \code{TRUE}, only the global test is performed.}

\item{n_perm}{: minimum test sample size needed to use the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic.}

\item{B}{: number of replications to compute critical values and global \emph{p}-value. Default value is 10^3.}

\item{B_MC}{: number of replications to compute the Shiraishi test statistic.}

\item{seed}{: seed to ensure reproducible results.}
}
\value{
A list:
\itemize{
\item \code{lower_bound}: an integer which is the \eqn{(1 âˆ’ \alpha)}-confidence lower bound for
the number of true discoveries in closed testing procedure using the chosen local test.
\item \code{S}: a vector which is the selection set. If \code{NULL}, the selection set is the entire test set.
\item \code{global.pvalue}: a number which is the global \emph{p}-value, i.e., the \emph{p}-value that closed testing procedure uses to reject the global null.
\item \code{selection.pvalue}: a number which is the \emph{p}-value for the selected null. By default it is set equal to 1.
}
}
\description{
It performs closed testing method with Shiraishi local test using a shortcut
approximating the lower bound for the number of outliers when the outlier density is not monotone.
